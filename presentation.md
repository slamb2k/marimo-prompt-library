# VIRA RAG Presentation

## Summmary

This is a presentation on the use of RAG to perform code reviews against the MYDAR security documentation and the challenges associated with utilising a standard RAG approach.

## Problem Statement

When using RAG to perform code reviews, the MYDAR security documentation is not always clear on what is required to be reviewed. This can lead to confusion and delays in the review process.
